# Wavelets
Go-to repository for wavelet analysis code.

Requires `pycwt` and `Python 3.8` or higher.

Import quick_wavelet.py and then run either run_full_wavelet_analysis or run_double_wavelet_analysis.

After running run_double_wavelet_analysis, use plot_quick_double_results.gmt6 (requires Generic Mapping Tools v6 or higher), to recreate quick_double_results.jpg.
