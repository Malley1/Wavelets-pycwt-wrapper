# Wavelets
Go-to repository for wavelet analysis code.

Requires `pycwt` and `Python 3.8` or higher.

You can import `quick_wavelet` and then run either `run_full_wavelet_analysis` or `run_double_wavelet_analysis` (see `wrapper.py`).
Run `./plot_quick_double_results.sh` in Bash shell to recreate example below.
